# c# Language.
This repository contains a guide to learning C#. The guide covers the basics of C#.

### Introduction of C#:

* C# a programming language developed by Microsoft.
* C# startted with name COOL stand for C-like Object Oriented Language.
* Then thay colaborate to be part of .NET framework since 2000.




 **After you install IDE and now we will start to learn the C# language more.**


 ### Let's talk about the code structure, and what we learn from it.

 ```c#
using System;

namespace Project
{
   class Programm
   {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
             console.writeLine("Hello World!");
        }
   }
}
```

**Lest take it one by one** 

* The **using System** line means that you are using the System library in your project. Which gives you some useful classes like Console or functions/methods like WriteLine.
* **namespace** in C# are used to organize too many classes so that it can be easy to handle the application.
* **class** is handel all methods for this class.
* **static void Main(string[] args)** in tihs it include **Main** method, it is the start or any application in c#, the **Main** Specifies the action of the class when running
* **console.writeLine("Hello World!");**, this statment will executed by the **Main** method, it will print > Hello World!
